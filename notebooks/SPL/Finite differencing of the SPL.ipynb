    "The amount of river discharge likely affects the rate of bedrock river incision at each point along the river profile. Measuring discharge continuously at each point along a river would require a lot of stream gauges! Fortunately, **drainage area** (the planview area of a river basin contributing water flow to a given point on the landscape) provides a reasonable proxy for discharge in many landscapes and can easily be computed from a digital elevation model (DEM) or landscape evolution model using a flow routing algorithm (you'll write your own code to do this later in the course). Because, for now, we are only considering a 1-D river profile, we'll use an empirical relationship between distance from the ridgeline ${x}$ and drainage area ${A(x)}$, **Hack's Law**, to assign the drainage area at each distance node ([Hack 1957](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0294b/report.pdf)):\n",
